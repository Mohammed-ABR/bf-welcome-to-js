TODO: create a few variables(undefined):
- you need to add comments to show where the variable been
declared, initialized, read , reassigned,...
*/

// 1. Declare a variable without initializing it
let value; // The variable is declared but not initialized (undefined)

console.log(value); // Read the variable (it will print undefined)

// 2. Initialize the variable with undefined (optional, as it's the default value)
value = undefined; // The variable is now initialized with the value undefined

console.log(value); // Read the variable (it will print undefined)

// 3. Reassign the variable with a new undefined value
value = undefined; // The variable is reassigned to undefined again

console.log(value); // Read the variable after reassignment (it will print undefined)
