// 1. Declare a variable without initializing it
let number; // The variable is declared but not initialized (undefined)

console.log(number); // Read the variable (it will print undefined)

// 2. Initialize the variable with a numeric value
number = 10; // The variable is now initialized with the value 10

console.log(number); // Read the variable (it will print 10)

// 3. Reassign the variable with a new number
number = 25; // The variable is reassigned to a new value

console.log(number); // Read the variable after reassignment (it will print 25)
